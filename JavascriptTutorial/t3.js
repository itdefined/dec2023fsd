str1 = `Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday attended the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting at the party headquarters in Delhi. The BJP’s election committee meeting is currently underway. BJP Chief JP Nadda welcomed PM Narendra Modi at the party headquarters as he arrived for the meeting. The meeting scheduled to finalise candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan is underway at the party headquarters in the national capital.

According to the reports, candidates for about 60 to 70 seats in Rajasthan will be discussed in the BJP’s election committee meeting, while those for 31 seats in Chhattisgarh will be approved today in the presence of PM Modi.

The BJP is actively refining its election strategies for five states set to go to the polls, including Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The party has categorized all constituencies in these states into distinct groups labeled A, B, C, and D.

Category A includes seats where the party has consistently performed well while category B includes seats where the BJP has a mixed record of victories and losses. Category C includes seats where the party is deemed to be on a relatively weaker footing. In contrast, Category D seats have seen continuous BJP defeats in the last three elections, PTI reported.

Monthly GST collections have risen over the years. From averaging under Rs 1 lakh crore per month in 2017-18 - its first year - collections rose rapidly after the pandemic-hit 2020-21 to average Rs 1.51 lakh crore in 2022-23.

While the finance ministry noted that the average monthly gross GST collection in the first six months of 2023-24 is 11 percent higher than in the first half of 2022-23, the average monthly mop-up so far this year is only 9 percent higher than the average monthly collections for the whole of 2022-23.

As per the 2023-24 Budget, the Centre expects its GST collections to rise by 12 percent in the current financial year.

In September, Central GST was Rs 29,818 crore, State GST was Rs 37,657 crore, Integrated GST was Rs 83,623 crore, and compensation cess was Rs 11,613 crore.
